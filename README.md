# Word-Lights

A simple tkinter desktop application for generating color palettes from a text phrase and sending those colors to Tuya activated smart lights. The color palettes are generated by using the ColorThief kmeans algorithm on images downloaded from the Google-Images-Search library.

For this to work, you need to provide a Google custom search engine api key and search id, as well as credentials for the Tuya cloud API. These will have to be entered into the settings.yaml file.
